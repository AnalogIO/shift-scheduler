# Gurobi MIP solver
This is the general introduction to Gurobis solvers. This is mostly if you want to try and work with your own MIP solver to get an idea for how the gurobi solver does things. The program should have interfaces for easy plug and play with other solvers.

# Strawpoll API Documentation 
This is the general documentation for strawpoll. The relevant part is the getPollResult getter. This will show how the json is formatted. If you would like to use a different form interface (e.g Google forms) you need to change Form struct to fit with the json data you get back from that.
