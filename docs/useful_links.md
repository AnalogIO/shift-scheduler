# Gurobi MIP solver
This is the general introduction to Gurobi solvers. This is mostly if you want to try and work with your own MIP solver to get an idea for how the gurobi solver does things. The program should have interfaces for easy plug and play with other solvers.

# Minimum Cost Flow Algorithm
The program uses a minimum cost flow algorithm to solve based on the cp-algorithms implementation. You can read more about how it works and how to implement it here
