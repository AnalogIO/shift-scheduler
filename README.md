# aion-cli
This is a CLI tool that takes in requets/timeslot wishes in the form a google form and schedules them in a way that minimizes the number of conflicts.  

The tool uses ... as a solver and will output the schedule in a html file that is hosted locally on your machine, where it can also be downloaded as a ... file.
The intention is to make the html file display in a transparent manner the way the schedule was generated, so that the user can understand the reasoning behind the schedule.
